Scrips for preparing indentification and analysis of soaring-gliding behavior (Matlab) and for statistical analysis (R)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(1) circling_gliding_analysis (MATLAB script):
The script is used to run the functions indentifing the circling-gliding thermal soaring using various functions
    (a) FindSoaringCircling1 (MATLAB function): XX-NIR IS WORKING ON IT, new name needed-XX: 
        Circling soaring indentification 
    (b) FindGlide1 (MATLAB function): XX-NIR IS WORKING ON IT, new name needed-XX: 
        Gliding phase of the soaring. More than one gliding might be indentified for each soaring  event
    (c) OrganiseThermalTable & AddInfoToThermalTable (MATLAB functions):
        Collecting stats for the cicling part of thermal soaring. 
    (d)  SoarGlide_phases (MATLAB function):
        The function is used to alocate gliding phase to thermal cicling **
    (e) equal_interval_thermal (MATLAB function):
          The function is used to to devide the data into 10 minute sections and calculate thermal activity (or lack of it) in these equal time sections
    
    
    **Not for every circling phase a corresponding gliding is found.
