Scrips for preparing indentification and analysis of soaring-gliding behavior (Matlab) and for statistical analysis (R)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(1) circling_gliding_analysis (MATLAB script):
The script is used to run the functions identifying the circling-gliding thermal soaring using various functions
    (a) FindSoarAndGlide (MATLAB function): 
        (a.1) Circling soaring identification 
        (a.2) gliding indetification if the gliding phase fs no more than 60 s after soaring is finished **
    (b) OrganiseThermalTable & AddInfoToThermalTable (MATLAB functions):
        Collecting stats for the cycling part of thermal soaring. 
    (c) WindCalcultedThermals (MATLAB functions):
        The function is used to calculate wind direction and speed from the horizontal displacement of thermals
    (d) SoarGlide_phases (MATLAB function):
        The function is used calculate statistics of soaring-gliding sequences
    (e) equal_interval_thermal (MATLAB function):
        The function is used to divide the data into 10 minute sections and calculate thermal activity (or lack of it) in these equal time sections
    (f) AnalyseFlapRate (MATLAB function):
        The function used to divide the time in soaring and between soaring (glide phases are not considered here) into 10 second sections. 
        Flap rate and elevation above terrain is calculated for each section 
    (g) AnalyseFlapRateNoSoar (MATLAB function):
        The function used to create comparable file at areas where no thermals occur. 
        (g.1) random 5 minutes indexes generated as a proxy to thermal circling.
        (g.2) “gliding” of fixed length (10 min.) is divided into 10 sec. intervals and analyzed.

**Not for every circling phase a corresponding gliding is found.
