Scrips (Matlab) for analysis of general migration patterns of all individuals 
The scripts are used for cleaning, subsampling to 1 hour interval and analysis of general migration 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 (1) MigrationAnalysis_stage1_resample_and_recordStartEnd (MATLAB script): 
 The script is used for 
 (a) cleaning of the data 
 (b) division into days (sunrise to sunset)
 (c) subsampling to 1 hour interval
 (d) defining start and end of migration
 
 (2) MigrationAnalysis_stage2_add_speed_migrationBouts_sunrise (MATLAB script): 
 The script is used for 
 (a) calculation of ground speed on the subsampled data
 (b) calculation of migratory bouts (section of migratory movements)
 (c) calculation of dark/light for the subsampled data
 
 (3) MigrationAnalysis_stage3_TripLevel (MATLAB script): 
 The script is used for migration analysis for the entire trip level
 
 (4) MigrationAnalysis_stage4_MBoutLevel (MATLAB script): 
 The script is used for migration analysis for the migration bout level
 
 (5) MigrationAnalysis_Stage5_AddElevation (MATLAB script):
 The script is used to calculate elevation above ground. 
 For e-obs tags first the geoid undulation value was subtracted from the altitude above the ellipsoid to get ASL.
 Env-Data annotated DEM was then subtracted from ASL.
 
 (6) annotate weather XX-add the details-XX
 
 (7) TripLevelNJ  (R script): 
 statistical analysis and figure preparation for the entire trip level (adults only - excluding fist and second year juveniles)
 
 (8) TripLevelNJ  (R script): 
 statistical analysis and figure preparation for the migration bout level
